# 100 Days Of Code

## Day 1: July 9, 2024 

**Today's Progress**:Today, I started with Tailwind and built a basic landing page from scratch. I also completed the hashing module from Striver and solved three easy Recursion problems.

**Thoughts:** It was really fun working with tailwind. I spend total 4 hours today learning and practicing tailwind. Today I spent less time practicing DSA because of tailwind. and I was really struggling with Hashmap in Java and my friend helped me with that.
