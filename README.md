# 100 Days Of Code

### Day 1: July 9, 2024 

**Today's Progress**: _Today, I started with Tailwind and built a basic landing page from scratch. I also completed the hashing module from Striver and solved three easy Recursion problems._

**Thoughts:** _It was really fun working with Tailwind. I spent a total of 4 hours today learning and practicing Tailwind. Today, I spent less time practicing DSA because of Tailwind, and I was really struggling with HashMap in Java. My friend helped me with that._

### Day 2: July 10, 2024 

**Today's Progress**: _I started with my full stack project and made some slight changes to the navbar. I also completed the Sorting-I module from Striver's sheet. I solved three questions on selection, bubble, and insertion sort._

**Thoughts:** _I made a logo for 'Anecdot' using Tailwind in my blogging website. I struggled with insertion sorting code. Today, I managed less time for coding because I was shifting my room the whole day._

### Day 3: July 11, 2024 

**Today's Progress**: _Created a user authentication page for my upcoming project using React and Tailwind. I also completed all sorting algorithms and solved at least one question for each of them._

**Thoughts:** _I spent a total of 2 hours creating the user authentication page and got stuck on the page animation. I couldn't figure out why my page animation wasn't working. I also did merge sort and quick sort. Both sorting algorithms were complicated, but I got them working in the end._
